# Vet Clinic Database

This is a veterinary clinic management application designed to streamline the appointment scheduling process and workflow management of veterinary clinics, using Ruby language and PostgreSQL database manager. This application is the perfect solution for managing a veterinary clinic.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
